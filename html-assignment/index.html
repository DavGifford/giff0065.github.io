           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>Hi, my name is David Gifford. I work at a bakery as a Dough Boy and Scapegoat. I really like tea. I did some coding in high school, mostly Java and Python. I used to do 3d printing. I do enjoy cooking, I own a Santoku knife, which is just a Japanese chef knife.  </p>
           <p>Currently Iâ€™m mostly listening to Insane Clown Posse, Addison Grace, Mother Mother, The Gentle Men, and The Glorious Sons. I recently got into listening to vinyl. I don't have any tattoos but would like to get some. I am really enjoying this program. I have no idea really when this program was about when i applied.  </p>
